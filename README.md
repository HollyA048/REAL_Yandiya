# Yandiya App

The new and updated app for Yandiya

 - If you ever need assitance with react native - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-react-native/modules/introduction-to-react-native/cheatsheet
 - If you are using your own PC then install Expo Go on your phone, if your phone doesn't support Expo Go install Android Studio on your PC

# Pushing Code

 - Avoid directly committing to the main branch. Create a new branch and make a pull request.
 - Get someone else to approve your pull requests to make sure that it won't conflict with the rest of the app. 
 - Make sure that your code is working and tested before making a pull request.

# Code Standards

 - Name functions and variables using camelCase. (e.g. variableName)
 - Name files with capitalised words (e.g. LogoutScreen.js)
 - Use 4 spaces for indentation or use the default tab.
 - Document your functions. Make a comment directly above the function declaration describing the indended purpose of the function. 
 - Write a comment next to any confusing or ambugious code where it is not clear what the intent is. 
 - Shift+Alt+F is your friend, use it constantly (formats document automaticly)
